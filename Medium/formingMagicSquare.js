// A Magic Square is a n x n matrix of distinct element from 
//1 to n2 where the sum of any row, column or diagonal is always equal to same number. 
// Consider a 3 X 3 matrix, s, of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9] .
// We can convert any digit, a, to any other digit, b, in the range [1, 9] at cost |a â€“ b|. 
// Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost by
// changing zero or more of its digits. The task is to find minimum cost.
